        Imagine an island that has everything you ever wanted. One day is not enough to satisfy your senses. It can be an adventure like island hopping or just a relaxing activity like taking selfies inside a mangrove forest. One of its great advantages is the proximity. It can be reached by just a 20 minute boat ride from Larap Port. Come and experience “Isla Agua ni Cion”, the recently assessed tourism gem located in Barangay Salvacion, Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte. Once fully developed it can be the next top island destination in the province. It has a beauty of its own and features like no other island can offer.
      </h3>

          <h3>
            The unique feature of the island is its stunning mangrove forest. What makes it stand out from other mangrove forest is its crystal clear water. You can literally dive into it and the water under will not turn murky. Most of the mangrove forest has brackish water and not clear but this one is different. The mangrove trees in this island are dense and green, an indication of a healthy ecosystem. A mangrove walk made of sturdy bamboo was created and its main attraction is its three-storey view deck. From this elevation one can see the vast expanse of the mangrove forest and the 360 view where you can see other islands floating on the blue sea. It is very instagrammable that one hour is not enough just for the selfies. The mangrove walk has lamp post that lights the place so you can also enjoy it even at night. If you are lucky you can even see fireflies lighting the trees like Christmas lights.

      <p><h3>The island has a steady supply of clean water and electricity. Communication is also not a problem because mobile phone signal is strong in the island. This is because there is a tower in the nearby island. These factors will make developments much cheaper and easier like putting up accommodations, homestay and other amenities.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>When it comes to gastronomic delights, it offers unique dishes out of shellfish that can be found along the shores during low tide. These are the tuwad tuwad or totok-in also called top shell and bangkalan or cockles. These are found abundantly under the mangrove trees and the shore along the beach. The dishes that the locals made out of these shellfish are unique and delicious. The Adobong Bangkalan or cockles were cooked like dry Adobo style topped with mayonnaise.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>The island is already instagrammable in itself. You can post raw pictures in social media and you can surely get several likes. However, it can still be improved by planting ornamental plants that will complement the tropical island feel. Examples of these are Bougainvilla, Gumamela and Kalachuchi. This will transform the island into a paradise that can be a haven for pre-nuptial shoot, commercial shoots and even shooting full length movies and TV series.</h3></p>
